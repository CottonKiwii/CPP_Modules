# My CPP Modules
These are all the modules for learning C++ at 42 Vienna. 
## Discretion Advised

I advice **against** copying my code as it will not help you get better at Coding.
Before you even look at my code, ask yourself:
- Did I do research on the internet?
- Did I ask my peer on the left?
- Did I ask my peer on the right?
- Did I ask any peer that might know?

Good luck on your projects! 💖
